# Academic Profile

Hello there! I’m a graduate student and I completed my master’s in computer science, with a minor in cybersecurity, at [VIT Bhopal University](https://vitbhopal.ac.in/) in India. I did my master’s thesis under the thoughtful mentorship of [Matteo Campanelli](https://binarywhales.com/). This summer, I’m at CISPA as a research assistant, hosted by the wonderful [Doreen Riepel](https://doreenriepel.me/). With any luck and minimal cosmic interference, I’ll be starting my PhD in the near future.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on theoretical computer science and cryptography, with particular emphasis on:

1. Foundations of cryptography
2. Interactive proofs
3. Quantum cryptography
4. Property testing

## Secure Communication

For encrypted communications, my GPG public key is available at:

[OpenPGP Key Server](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/034FA3D4FD4067E5BCF30B6FCF8D56CABE52E5E9)

To retrieve the key via command line:

```bash
wget https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/034FA3D4FD4067E5BCF30B6FCF8D56CABE52E5E9
```
