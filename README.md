# About Me

Hey! I'm a grad student who completed a master's in computer science with a minor in cybersecurity at VIT Bhopal University in India, during which I had the opportunity to work with Matteo Campanelli. This summer, Iâ€™m excited to be joining CISPA as an intern under the supervision of Doreen Riepel.
